## Motivation

The motivation of this project is to explore a simple dataset with the aim of illustrating how a more general procedure, CRISP-DM, could be used to approach a data science project.

## Requirements

Listed in requirements.txt. Not meeting the specific version is probably fine, but may break certain functions if using old versions of these libraries. 

## File Descriptions

- house_price_notebook.ipynb: a Jupyter Notebook for the main analysis.
- data_description.txt: a text file describing the data. Note that I won't follow this exactly during my analysis. 
- train.csv & test.csv: train and test datasets in comma delimit format. 
- requirements.txt: lists libraries required for the notebook to run. 

## Getting started 

Install libraries from requirements.txt. Then just run the notebook, keeping both train and test data files in the same folder.
